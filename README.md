# Rainfall Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting rainfall using historical weather data. The dataset contains daily meteorological observations collected over one year and is suitable for building both classification and regression-based machine learning models.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of **366 daily weather records**, representing a complete annual cycle. Each record contains **12 meteorological features** related to atmospheric conditions, temperature, and precipitation.

---

## 🔍 Dataset Overview
- **Total records:** 366  
- **Total features:** 12  
- **Data types:** Numerical (integer and floating-point) and categorical  
- **Memory usage:** ~34.4 KB  

---

## 🧹 Data Quality & Preprocessing
- The dataset is **mostly complete**, with only **one missing value each** in `winddirection` and `windspeed`.
- The `rainfall` feature is **categorical** and requires encoding before training machine learning models.
- All remaining features are numerical and can be used directly for modeling.
- Minimal preprocessing is required.

## 🎯 Intended Use Cases
This dataset is suitable for:
- Rainfall prediction and classification  
- Weather pattern and trend analysis  
- Machine learning models (Regression & Classification)  
- Time-series and seasonal analysis

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Incorporate advanced ensemble models  
- Perform feature importance analysis  
- Deploy model as a web application
